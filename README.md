## **🧑‍💻 About Me**

I am a passionate, self-driven learner who loves building technology that solves real-world problems. My journey started in electrical installation, where I learned discipline, precision, and systems thinking. Over time, I transitioned into software development because I wanted to create tools that help people and simplify complex tasks.

I thrive on learning — whether it’s writing better code, understanding system administration, or breaking down complex ideas into simple explanations.
